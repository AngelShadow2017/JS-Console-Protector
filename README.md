# JS-Console-Protector
A Protector to disable other to view your code

I think it is a good protector to protector your code... (I don't care what other people think~)

just ... Use it

(Put this file in your project and link this file to <head></head>)

e.g.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="console.min.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
```
